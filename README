Description:
wardrobe is a sensor triggered video player for the Raspberry Pi with configurable timeouts and repeat plays.

It is mainly bash scripts and, where possible, is compatible with any Linux system which has a /sys/class/gpio interface.

Future hopes:
  Support configuration files for the player
  Move to dash instead of bash for busybox support
  Provide deb package
  Encourage more versatile /sys/class/gpio support (enable pull-up/pull down resistors if available?)
  Rename it to something more descriptive than "wardrobe" - which comes from its original use as a Pepper's Ghost style illusion in a wardrobe for Rik Lander's "Memory Dealer"


Parts list:
  wardrobe - script to listen to the sensor and call the player - Tarim.
  omxplayer - Edgar Hucek's video player for Raspberry Pi.
  poll - blocked wait read of a sensor pin exported to /sys/class/gpio/gpioX/value file.  Contrary to its name, it _doesn't_ poll with a busy wait but goes blocked and waits for an interrupt.  Inspired by Radek "Mrkva" Pilari's gpio-irq-demo.c, - Tarim.
  hwctl - a script to control hardware through /sys/class/gpio.  Can be used as a (limited) drop in replacement for gpio - Tarim.
  gpio - Gordon Henderson's gpio pin control prograqm for the Raspberry Pi.  Called by hwctl when there is no /sys/class/gpio support for a feature.  (If you don't need pull-up/pull-down resistors then you can omit this.)
